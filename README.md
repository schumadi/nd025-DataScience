## Motivation for the project
Most AirBnB projects deal with prices, their seasonality etc. I wanted to analyze a different aspect. I therefore chose the topic "ratings hosts and superhosts". Is it possible to predict the ratings in the listings? Which features influence the ratings? What are differences between host and superhosts? Last but not least: Can a model predict the superhost status.

## Files in the repository
